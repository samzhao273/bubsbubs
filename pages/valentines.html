First and foremost, you are someone that I always cherished and will always cherish and someone who I found so so special in so many ways. Your continuous care, your empathy, kindness, and warm-heartedness are only a few of the infinitely great things about you as a person. Not only are you so so physically beautiful, but somehow, someway I hit the jackpot because your personality is the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced. The warm fuzzy feeling you make everyone around you feel, the laughter people share caused by you, and the comfort that everyone feels are just a few things that you cause.\n\nLike you, never in a million years would I think I would be able to be with someone as thoughtful as you because I just didn't think you existed. I have never felt so confident in wanting a relationship to work out and I only gain this confidence because I'm with you. I hope you know how much I appreciate your patience with myself, my growth, my issues, and everything that comes with being with me and as we continue to grow, I am very confident of whatever life (or me interally) throws at us!\n\nI apolgize with my way of words, but I hope that through my actions you'll be able to feel even just a fraction of the way you make me feel. Being with you is like having an ever recurring cycle of diabetes and insulin, where your sweetness causes it but your groundedness and our stability in us complements it. I can't wat to meet the people who you hold dear in your life, experience living life with you, and continuously growing together forever :)\n\nSo with all that being said, will you, my bubs, Angelini Belini Ling, be my \n\n Valentine?";
